* Nama deskriptif saja dan tidak digunakan secara internal.
* Use the amount (min) and (max) to indicate expected limits for the bill. These amounts are used to give you an idea of the amount of bills you have to pay each period.
* If you enter a number in the "skip" fields, the bill will be automatically skipped every X times; a bill that arrives every 3 months can be entered by filling in "3".

To match each bill to a transaction, you will be guided towards the page that allows you to create a bill. On this page you can enter the details of the kind of transaction you would want to match the bill.

If you edit a bill and change the amount, the rule will not be automatically updated to match.
