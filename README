# Firefly III help pages

This repository contains the help text that [Firefly III](https://github.com/JC5/firefly-iii) shows you when you press the (?) icon.

These texts are available in any language Firefly III is available in. However, translations may not be as up to date as the English texts.

I kindly invite you to come over to [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/firefly-iii-help) and help me translating!
