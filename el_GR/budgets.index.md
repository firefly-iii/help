On this page, you can set budgets. Each budget is valid for the current time period only (look to the top right).

**Set up budgets in Firefly III**

First, set the amount that is available to you by clicking the pencil icon next to "*Available in ~~~*". By default, this is zero. Click the (i) icon to get an indication of what you could spend next month. In this example, I shall use 1000,-.

Then, create some budgets with the "Create a budget" button either in the center of the screen or in the top right menu. All you need for a budget is a name.

Once you've created some budgets you can set the amount of the budget using the input below the name. If you have already spent money in a budget, this will be shown as well. You can see that the top blue bar will update. It will be blue if you have budgeted all the money available, and turn red / orange if you budget more money than you have.

Both the amount available and the amount budgeted are for a specific period: if you go back a month or forward a month, both of these amounts are reset. Firefly III will remember what you've set the amounts to of course, but every period has their own amounts.

In your preferences, you can change this range to be weekly, or even yearly.
