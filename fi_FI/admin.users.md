This page shows you an overview of all the users in your installation. Usually, this is just one user (you).

Jokaisen kent√§n tulisi olla ilmeinen. The "block code" will never be filled in for your own account, but always for others. They may be filled in when the user is deleted (by you) or when the user has changed their email address.
