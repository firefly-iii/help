**Import data into Firefly III**

This page allows you to import data into Firefly III. To do so, export data from your bank, or from another financial management system. Upload that file here. Firefly III will convert the data. You need to give it some directions. Please select a file and follow the instructions.

**Import "configuration"**

As you will discover over the next few pages, this import routine has a lot of settings. These settings are mainly dependent on the bank (or financial management software) your file comes from. There is a good chance somebody else already imported such a file and has shared their configuration file. Please visit the **[import configuration center](https://github.com/firefly-iii/import-configurations/wiki)** to see if there already is a configuration available for your bank or system. If there is, you should download this configuration file and upload it here as well. It will save you a lot of time!

**Warning**

The import function of Firefly III is in beta. Many users of Firefly III have tried many different files. Although each individual compontent of this import routine works (really), the combination might break. If your file cannot be imported by Firefly, please read [this wiki page](https://github.com/JC5/firefly-iii/wiki/Submit-issues-with-sensitive-data-in-them) so I can fix the problem you have run into.
