Each rule starts with a basic name and trigger moment: when will the rule fire? Is the rule even active? What is the description of the rule?

Then you may add as many triggers as you want. Every trigger must be hit for a rule to be activated (AND). These triggers can be anything from the name of the source account to the number of attachments. It is completely up to you.

Then, Firefly III responds by executing actions. You can add as many actions as you like, in any order.

Rules are also applied to imported transactions.
