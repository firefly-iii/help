You can use this view to reconcile an asset account.

First, enter a date range and set the opening and start balance as it shows on your bank statement. It is assumed that these are correct of course, but this we shall find out now. Then, click "start reconciling".

Firefly III will show you the transactions from this range, plus some extra transactions just for good measure. Select all transactions that appear on your bank statements.

When you are done selecting transactions, the amount under "Reconciliation options" should be zero. It could be that it is different.

* When the amount is below zero, your Firefly III asset account has less money in it than your bank says it should have.
* When the amount is more than zero, your Firefly III asset account has more money in it than your banks says it should have.

Either way, press "Store reconciliation" to store the result. The transactions will be marked as "cleared" and you can optionally create a transaction that will correct the balance of your Firefly III asset account (a reconciliation).
