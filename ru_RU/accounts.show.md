This page shows you the balances and latest transactions for an account. Depending on the type of account, things may seem weird:

**Основные счета**

Asset accounts show the amount of money in (earnings) and money out (expenses) as you would expect.

**Счета расходов**

Expense accounts mention "earned" amounts despite the fact that you spend money at them. This is because the expense account is earning money, from the perspective of the expense account. After all, what you spend at your supermarket is an earning for them.

**Счета доходов**

Just like how expense accounts mention earned amounts, revenue accounts mention "spent" amounts because technically, money you receive by a revenue account is spent by them.

**Долги**

This overview shows the state of your liabilities.
