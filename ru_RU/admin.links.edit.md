You can edit the transaction links you have created yourself. Links are described with three properties:

* The description. This is obvious.
* Inward description. This describes how transaction A is influenced by B. Imagine transaction B "flying in" and changing transaction A somehow.
* Outward description. This describes how transaction B is influencing A. Like the previous example, but in reverse.

You can edit each transaction link as you see fit, but they must be unique.
