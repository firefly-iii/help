Firefly III has some default links, but you can always add more. Links are described with three properties:

* The description. This is obvious.
* Inward description. This describes how transaction A is influenced by B. Imagine transaction B "flying in" and changing transaction A somehow.
* Outward description. This describes how transaction B is influencing A. Like the previous example, but in reverse.

You can create as many transaction links as you want, but they must be unique.

If you want to read more about transaction links, check out the [official documentation on transaction links](https://docs.firefly-iii.org/advanced-concepts/links).
