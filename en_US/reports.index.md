Firefly III offers a number types of reports. Each report can be bookmarked for easy access. Each report has various options you must set.

For ALL reports, you must indicate which asset accounts will be included in the report. If you do not include certain asset accounts, transfers from and to those ignored accounts will count as expenses and income.

You must select a date range for each report. There are no limits to the date range you select. You can also use **magic words**, read more about them in [the official documentation](https://docs.firefly-iii.org/advanced-concepts/reports).

#### Default financial report

This report will give you a global overview of your finances and it is most used to see (both for the past as wel as for the present) your current financial overview. This report has no extra options.

#### Transaction history overview (audit)

This report will tell you how your accounts have gotten to their current point. It shows ALL transactions, and ALL available metadata. This can help you track down errors in your finances. Imagine this report as the "Account overview" but on steroids. This report has no extra options.

#### Budget report

This report will tell you what you have spent in the selected budgets, on the selected asset accounts. This means you must select both the relevant asset accounts as well as the relevant budgets. 

#### Category report

This report will tell you what you have spent and earned in the selected categories, on the selected asset accounts. This means you must select both the relevant asset accounts as well as the relevant categories. 

#### Tag report

This report will tell you what you have spent and earned in the selected tags, on the selected asset accounts. This means you must select both the relevant asset accounts as well as the relevant tags.

#### Expense/revenue account report

This report is available for accounts that are both sources of income, and places where you spent money. If you work at a super market like Walmart, this could be the case. This report allows you to combine such accounts and see what the balance is.
