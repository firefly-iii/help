New currencies can always be added to Firefly III if yours is not present by default. Please make sure the currency code is compliant with ISO 4217.

Currencies tend to have 2 decimal places. You should check out Wikipedia for more information about your preferred currency, if you are unsure. If you want to know what the values are for your currency, check out [this list of currencies](https://github.com/xsolla/currency-format/blob/master/currency-format.json) on Github. New currencies are enabled by default.

Please note that each currency needs:

- A symbol, such as $ or â‚¬ or something else.
- A code, such as EUR or USD or something you make up.
- A name, of course.
