This page shows the accounts you have. It lists the current balance and the latest date of activity.

There's something weird with expense accounts. Even though you pay into expense accounts, they tend to have a positive balance. Likewise, revenue accounts have a negative balance. At first glance this should be reversed. But remember that when you pay McDonalds, they *earn* money. Likewise, when your employer pays you, they *lose* money. For you personally it's the exact opposite but this list is from their perspective. A store makes money off you, an employer loses money to you.

There are three types of accounts.

**Asset accounts**

Accounts that hold your money: your bank accounts.

**Expense accounts**

These represent the people you pay. Shops are likely.

**Revenue accounts**

These represent the people that pay you. Your job for example.

**Liabilities**

These are your debts, loan, mortgage(s).
