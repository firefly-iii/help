Almost everybody has regular expenses that come back every month, quarter or year. In Firefly III, you can register such expenses as "bills".

When you create bills, Firefly III will report on the expected amount of bills for each period of time. Firefly III uses rules to match transactions to bills. This way you can match your expenses to the bills you have (yet) to pay.
 
In short, you can create a bill for "rent" or for "insurance" and every month, Firefly III will show you if you paid for it.
