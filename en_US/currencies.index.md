These are the currencies your installation currently supports.

Firefly III is a multi-currency system. You can safely use Dollars and Euros at the same time.

You can freely add new currencies, existing ones or custom ones. You can also enable them and disable them.

Please note that each currency needs:

- A symbol, such as $ or â‚¬ or something else.
- A code, such as EUR or USD or something you make up.
- A name, of course.

The Euro cannot be disabled or removed.
