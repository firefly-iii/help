This page allows you to export transactions. You will get a CSV file with *all* your transactions in it.

If you want more fine-grained control over the export, or if you want to export other files as well, please use the command line options.

If you want to read more about exporting data, check out the [official documentation on exporting data](https://docs.firefly-iii.org/exporting-data/export).
