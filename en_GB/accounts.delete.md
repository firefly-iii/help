Only create revenue accounts for places where you get money from. If you're deleting an asset account and you've transferred money between the current asset account and other asset accounts, you might see changed balances all around. Remember to correct this, if necessary.

You can move the transactions to a new account if you wish to preserve them.

If you want to read more about accounts, check out the [official documentation on accounts](https://docs.firefly-iii.org/concepts/accounts).
